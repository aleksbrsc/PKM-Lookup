# PKM Lookup
Inspired by the Black & White Pokédex, try it @ [pkmlookup.vercel.app](https://pkmlookup.vercel.app)

## The Problem
Both competitive and casual players waste time looking up pokemon details: 

- Looking up pokemon weaknesses on google (random results each time, often [without multipliers](https://www.google.com/search?q=dragonite+weakness&rlz=1C5CHFA_enCA1073CA1074&oq=dragonite+weakness&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUqCggAEAAYsQMYgAQyCggAEAAYsQMYgAQyBwgBEAAYgAQyBwgCEAAYgAQyBwgDEAAYgAQyBwgEEAAYgAQyBwgFEAAYgAQyBwgGEAAYgAQyBwgHEAAYgAQyBwgIEAAYgAQyBwgJEAAYgATSAQgxNzQxajBqN6gCALACAA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8))
- finding things on bulbapedia (having to scroll through an endless encyclopedia, or click around too much)
- using the official [pokédex website](https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokedex/dragonite) and losing your search bar by clicking on a pokemon
- memorizing the 18x18 type effectiveness chart (then having to guess whether Magnezone has levitate or not)
- getting unwanted Pokémon Go search results
  
and the list goes on...

The amount of time that could be spent enjoying the games more instead of building an encyclopedic knowledge by constantly searching things up compounds quickly. Some of the 100+ million people who enjoy playing the games developed by the highest-grossing media franchise in the world [seem to agree](https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/kgtqh2/i_am_so_tired_of_seeing_pokemon_go_results/)

## The Solution
PKM Lookup is a web app built with Vite + React using the [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) to let users view pokemon info efficiently in a single-page application.

#### Key Features
- Essential Info: Type effectiveness, abilities, evolution details, catch rates, base stats, learnsets, and more.
- Accessibility: Focus the search bar with `Ctrl + /` (Windows/Linux) or `⌘ + /` (macOS), and navigate the list of pokemon using `Tab` and select with `Enter`.
- Better UX/UI: useful and easy on the eye, unlike dozens of other pokemon info websites or apps
